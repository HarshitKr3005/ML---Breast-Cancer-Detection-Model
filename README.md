# Breast Cancer Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for the detection of breast cancer using data related to tumor characteristics. The model aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on certain features.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. These features include characteristics such as tumor size, texture, symmetry, and other relevant factors. The dataset also includes labels indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Model Training
The breast cancer detection model is built using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or random forests. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess how well the model predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning for improved accuracy.

- Gathering larger and more diverse datasets to enhance the model's ability to generalize to different populations.

- Exploring additional features or imaging modalities that could improve the predictive power of the model.
